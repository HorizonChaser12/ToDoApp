# To-Do App
This is a simple To-Do App made using Flutter. It has the basic functionalities, such as adding tasks, deleting tasks, and some smooth visual transitions for task deletion. This project served as a foundation to enhance my understanding of Flutter. I plan to make it visually more appealing and incorporate additional features in the near future.

# Here is a visual of the app I have made:
