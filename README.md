# todo_app
This is a simple To-Do App made using Flutter.Has the same basic funcionalities like adding tasks,deleting tasks and some booth visual transitions for deleting. This is a basic project that I have used to upgrade my understanding in Flutter. Will make it visually more beautiful and add other useful things in the near future.

# Here is a visual of the app I have made:
